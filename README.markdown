**RoboGuice classes for use with ActionBarSherlock**

Both RoboGuice and ActionBarSherlock require custom base classes for Activities
and Fragments, and as Java doesn't permit diamond-inheritance, or the [traits](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/126)
of Scala, this project provides custom RoboGuice classes that extend the corresponding
ones from ActionBarSherlock.

[JakeWharton](https://github.com/JakeWharton) provided the first example of how
to do this with a [RoboSherlockActivity](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock/blob/4.0.0/samples/roboguice/src/com/actionbarsherlock/sample/roboguice/RoboSherlockActivity.java):
it's a simple drudge process of taking the source for the RoboGuice class and
changing the activity/fragment named in the `extends` declaration to the
corresponding ActionBarSherlock class - there are no further complications
I've encountered so far.

All classes in this project have the same name as the RoboGuice ones, with 'Sherlock'
inserted after the 'Robo', ie `Robo**Sherlock**ListFragment`. The package is also changed
to `com.github.vmotvmot.android.sherlock.roboguice.**`.
